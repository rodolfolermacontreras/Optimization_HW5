    "The previous problem you shared about assigning landing slots to airlines is indeed a type of combinatorial optimization problem, and more specifically, a kind of Knapsack Problem, which is a common packing problem. The goal was to maximize the total bid price while ensuring each slot is assigned at most once and each airline is awarded at most one bid.\n",

In our case, we have a similar situation with binary variables, but the logical constraints are slightly different. Our binary variables are whether or not a route is taken (1 if taken, 0 if not). The constraint we need to satisfy is that each distribution center's demand is met by at least one route."
